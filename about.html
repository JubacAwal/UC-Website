        <h2 class="section-title">The History of the University of the Cordilleras</h2>
        <p>Baguio Colleges, as the University of the Cordilleras was earlier known, pioneered in tertiary education in the mountain highlands of the Cordillera region amidst devastation in and around Baguio City after the Second World War.<br>

Despite a pessimistic outlook and the bleak prospects pervading the climate of any undertaking at that time, Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa envisioned Baguio City as a university town. With such vision, he undauntedly pursued a noble mission by founding a college.<br><br>

<strong>Baguio Colleges</strong><br><br>

It was on June 19, 1946, coinciding with the birth anniversary of Dr. Jose P. Rizal, that a historic event unfolded. Baguio Colleges was established initially offering courses in teacher training and liberal arts, with the first batch of enrollees consisting of 156 students. Classes were first held in rented spaces at the Antipolo building, and later, at the Lopez and Lamping buildings along Session Road, the city's main thoroughfare.<br>

1966 became a turning point for Baguio Colleges as it was converted into an educational foundation. Since then, it has blazed new trails and has become more responsive to the needs of the time.<br><br>

The founder, Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa sat as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and held the reins of the presidency up to the early part of 1994.<br>

Through the years, the University of the Cordilleras has grown bigger through the offering of additional courses and increasing student enrollment. It continues to grow even better with time, as evidenced by exemplary performance in various fields of discipline, with its graduates shining in national licensure examinations, and its alumni doing well in private employment, in the practice of their trade and profession, and in public service.<br><br>

<strong>UC</strong><br><br>

Today, the University of the Cordilleras caters to more than 18,000 students coming from the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), Regions I and II, neighboring provinces of Luzon. In addition, UC has the largest population of international students among HEIs in Baguio City represented by 37 nationalities. Programs offered now range from basic education to graduate studies, law, arts and sciences, business and accountancy, nursing, teacher education, information technology and computer science, hospitality and tourism, and criminal justice.<br><br>

UC has received recognitions which are testaments to its delivery of quality educational services. In 2019, UC's was hailed ISO 9001:2015 Certified. The Commission on Higher Education has granted UC the Autonomous University Status. The commission has likewise identified three (3) Centers of Excellence in UC namely Information Technology, Criminology, and Teacher Education. The University's College of Law is rated among the top law schools in the country, notably having graduated two (2) Bar Examination First Placers. Additionally, over 20 programs have been accredited by private accrediting bodies.<br><br>

The University of the Cordilleras is blessed to serve these mountain highlands..<br></p>

            <p>The City of Baguio has grown, developed and blossomed into a notable regional center of education of the country, --- from its charter date as a city in September 9, 1909, --- up to today, 112 years later.<br><br>

The University of the Cordilleras has evolved into an institution that is vibrant, significant, and relevant to the life and times of the nation; --- from its founding date of June 19, 1946, --- up to today, its 75th school year.<br><br>

Having logged 75 school years as an institution of higher learning, UC remains ever grateful to its home, the City of Baguio and to the Cordillera region.<br><br>

UC is indeed privileged to serve the nation as a beacon of higher education, blessedly situated in a mountain highlands setting; --- Baguio City, in the heart of the Cordillera region.<br><br>

Indeed, a day does not go in UC without serving a cue to its university community --- of the institutional calling --- ‘to serve and to give back,’ --- in terms of university resources and outreach, --- to its home community and region --- the City of Baguio and the Cordillera.<br></p>
            <h6><u>This is Who We Are</u></h6>
            <p>“To Serve” and “To Give Back” constitutes the “DNA,” or the genetic imprint of the University of the Cordilleras.<br><br>

The source of these “genes” can be traced to the enduring vision and legacy of the Founders of UC. In investing assets in Baguio Colleges Inc. in 1946, UC’s Founders deemed it then as high honor, their being granted the privilege of educating the youth of the land. Thus, as an embodiment of the honor and respect that they held in having been entrusted with such privilege, --- they committed the original capital they invested in the school as a permanent investment; subsequently allocating for the benefit of the institution, all the earnings thereon.<br><br>

Thus in 1967, at the 21st school year of the institution, UC’s Founders substantiated their intentions to consider the school as beyond proprietary interests. They initiated a re-organization of Baguio Colleges Inc. They formed in its place, a Foundation. They then donated their corporate and personal assets to the Baguio Colleges Foundation, the entity which has evolved into the University of the Cordilleras of today.<br><br>

In effect, UC’s Founders decided, willfully and voluntarily, “to give it all back,” unconditionally and in perpetuity. This they executed by signing an irrevocable deed of donation. In doing so, UC’s founders transformed the trajectory of the institution.<br><br></p>
          
          <h6><u>Nothing Taken Out; Every Resource Reinvested</u></h6>
            <p>This is the vision and the legacy that governs UC today: Each school year, UC invests and continues to re-invest all its revenue and earnings back to the institution and its pursuit of its core mission.<br><br>

As a consequence of this initiative by its Founders, UC took on the character of an organization that conducts its business without the pressure of serving the interests of shareholders or the “bottom line.”<br><br>

Having statutorily relinquished ownership, UC’s founders unleashed the energy and resources of the organization solely towards the upgrading of university standards. The intent is that --- this “game plan” would ensure an unerring path towards excellence, fueled by the deployment of the university’s resources bearing down fully on the university’s academic degree, research and community extension programs.<br><br>

Having voluntarily relinquished the ownership benefits thereon, the fruit of corporate operations, thus, would gravitate and inure, as a natural consequence, to its core mission of opening platforms of educational opportunity to the university constituency --- i.e., the students, the faculty, the staff, the parents, the alumni and ultimately, --- the city and the region; --- and the nation and society in general.<br><br>

The management successors of UC’s Founders therefore, while inheriting corporate control over the university, have thus been transformed from their traditional role of shareholders to that of faithful stewards of UC’s vision of the application of altruism towards its educational mission.<br><br>

Today, UC strives to shun any semblance of becoming “an ivory tower”; isolated and oblivious to the concerns and conditions of its country, its home community and region.<br><br></p>

            <h6><u>Our Intentions</u></h6>
            <p>Upon the altruistic platform forged by the founder’s intentions hereon, we intend to substantiate their vision and legacy in concrete terms: through human development projects, specific and general, conducted within the span of operations of the school.<br><br>

This we commit and pledge, with deep humility; and also, with an abiding respect for the indomitable spirit of the proud people of these mountain highlands, acknowledging our obligation to foster intrinsic Cordillera culture and traditions. We dutifully manifest this commitment in the setting of these commencement exercises being held today.<br><br></p>

            <h6><u>A Noble Privilege</u></h6>
            <p>In faithfulness to the intentions of the Founders of UC, we hereby duly guarantee, by our conduct and actions, to continue to provide diverse and significant opportunities for the youth of the land.<br><br></p>
